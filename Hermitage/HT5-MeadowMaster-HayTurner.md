# HT5 “MeadowMaster” Hay Turner (Tedder)

> "Harness the power of the sun with the 1953 MeadowMaster — the latest innovation from Phillips Brothers of Surrey. Finished in our enduring Heritage Green with cream detail and oxide red decals, it’s a machine that looks as sharp as it works. Whether clover or rye, let the MeadowMaster lift, turn, and dry with gentle strength. Built at Hermitage Works — built to last."
